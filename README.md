Trial-project-review:

For this repository, I've created a repo to review my trial project to review the following in the project:
Apply best practices in HTML code.
Use semantic HTML tags.
Use CSS selectors correctly.
Use CSS box model.
Perform a code review for yourself on a past project.

I used ESlint to manage the files for the front-end, using loaders for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, in order to fix some special thing at the moment to use the front-end in a server. Feel free to suggest more additional features for this repository, or if you want to use it, feel free to do that as well.
